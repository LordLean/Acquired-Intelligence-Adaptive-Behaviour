### **Recap**:
#### Old fashioned AI is Symbolic
* Input the symbolic description of the problem to be solved. <br> Use knowledge about the problem domain construct a programme that manipulates the input + forms a solution.

* Focus on the structure and content of the representations and the nature and efficiency of the algorithms.

#### Connectionism
* Information is not symbolically represented in the brain. 
<br> Instead information is distributed across networks.
* Neural Network conceived 1950s.
<br> Took off 1980s.


GOFAI and Connectionism are **static**: 
- Sense $\rightarrow$ Plan $\rightarrow$ Action


### **Nouvelle Artificial Intelligence**:
#### GOFAI and Connectionism:
* Input/Output dynamically bound up through time.
* Cannot decompose system in time to sense-plan-act.
* Coherent behaviour emerges only from the dynamic interaction between brain/body and environment.

### **Deliberative Intelligence**:
* Offline
* Static 
* Disembodied
### **Perfomative Intelligence**:
* Engaged 
* Dynamic 
* Embodied

### **Brains misunderstood as Computers**:
* Pervasive idea of brains performing computations due to computing success.
* However - the way people think they achieve a task is different to how they actually achieve it.

### **Cybernetics**:
* Emphasise the corporeal and performative.
* Focuessed on problems of machines acting in the real world.
* **Feedback** - Reciprocal coupling between world and machine became central Cybernetics.
* As oppose to deliberate and mental of GOFAI.

#### Its roots of Nouvelle AI:
* Nouvelle AI - the study of machines that dynamically interact with their environment.
* Presence of strong feedback differentiates NAI from GOFAI.
* There can be feedback in sense plan act models but it is slow and not central.
