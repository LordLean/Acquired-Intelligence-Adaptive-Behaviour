    "### **Recap**:\n",
    "#### Old fashioned AI is Symbolic\n",
    "* Input the symbolic description of the problem to be solved. <br> Use knowledge about the problem domain construct a programme that manipulates the input + forms a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focus on the structure and content of the representations and the nature and efficiency of the algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connectionism\n",
    "* Information is not symbolically represented in the brain. \n",
    "<br> Instead information is distributed across networks.\n",
    "* Neural Network conceived 1950s.\n",
    "<br> Took off 1980s.\n",

    "### **Nouvelle Artificial Intelligence**:\n",
    "#### GOFAI and Connectionism:\n",
    "* Input/Output dynamically bound up through time.\n",
    "* Cannot decompose system in time to sense-plan-act.\n",
    "* Coherent behaviour emerges only from the dynamic interaction between brain/body and environment.\n",

    "### **Brains misunderstood as Computers**:\n",

    "* However - the way people think they achieve a task is different to how they actually achieve it.\n",

    "* Focuessed on problems of machines acting in the real world.\n",

    "* Nouvelle AI - the study of machines that dynamically interact with their environment.\n",
    "* Presence of strong feedback differentiates NAI from GOFAI.\n",
    "* There can be feedback in sense plan act models but it is slow and not central."
